# datastructures_cplusplus
Some data structures created from scratch, written in c++ and VIM

# Objectives
This repository has two main objectives:
1. Learn how really datastructures work and improve my low-level knowledge of design
2. Learn how to use VIM properly and C++ in the most efficient way

# Test
I would like to test my implementations by using the real built-in language structures and see if they behave in the same way, maybe also by measuring the real time required to perform operations and mybe discover something new about them

# Execution
By now there's not amek file to properly compile all the files together.

 Since there's only a main function inside the map_test.cpp file by now, you can singularly compile the files by using 
 `g++ -c linkedList.cpp`, `g++ -c map.cpp` and then use `g++ map_test.cpp -o test.out`

 # Contributing
 Feel free to join! I would be nice to understand how to improve the implementations :)
